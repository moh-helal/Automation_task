I used POM design pattern with data driven testing framework using excel files attached.
The test classes are commented in " testNG.xml " file as classes for running for execution, example: <!-- <class name="webpagestest.AuthNewUserTest"/> -->
Also, " value " in " testNG.xml " for testing " chrome " and " firefox ", just change between them for cross browser testing.
